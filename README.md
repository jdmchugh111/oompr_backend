## Intro

This is the backend repository for Oompr, an application that allows you to "window shop" for luxury real estate listings. Oompr (which is in acronym for Out Of My Price Range) allows users to search by city and be shown the most expensive real estate listings in that city. Users can also log in and create a list of saved listings which they can go back to in their user dashboard.
